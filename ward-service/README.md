# WardServiceApp

## Overview

Provides lists of wards and departments.

Part of the [HealthSafe](../README.md) project. Independent Maven module, no
parent pom.

MQ: this service subscribes to the ActiveMQ topic `staffing-events-topic` — see [`../common/`](../common) — and publishes to the ActiveMQ queue `equipment-failure-queue` when it detects an equipment failure on one of its wards, consumed by [`../equipment-alert-service`](../equipment-alert-service). Broker URL, topic name, and queue name come from the common `co.wethinkcode.healthsafe.mq.MqConfig` class alongside it in this module.

REST: called by `staffing-service` (`../staffing-service`) and `alert-level-service` (`../alert-level-service`) — see [Integration contracts](../README.md#integration-contracts) in the root README for the endpoint shapes.

## Test

No automated tests yet. Manually verify it's up:

```
curl http://localhost:7031/health   # -> OK
curl http://localhost:7031/wards # -> Gets all wards as json
curl http://localhost:7031/wards/{id} -> gets ward by id
curl -X POST http://localhost:7031/wards/W-05/equipment-failure -d "final check" -> Queued failure for ward id.
```

To add real tests, add JUnit 5 + the Surefire plugin to `pom.xml`, put tests under
`src/test/java/co/wethinkcode/healthsafe/`, and run `mvn test`.
